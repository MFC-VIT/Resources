Accuracy fails when the class labels are highly unbalanced, simply because the accuracy will be high owing to the model predicting a large number of samples as belonging to the majority class label. In such cases, f1 score is a better metric. There are some other metrics like ROC_AUC, which stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve. That is, it returns the area under the ROC curve.</p>"
